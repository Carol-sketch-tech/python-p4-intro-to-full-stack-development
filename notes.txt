FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT.

OBJECTIVES 
    1. use react and flask together to build a beautiful and powerful web application.
    2. Organize client and server code so that it is easy ti understand and maintain.
    3. Create websocket connections between clients and server to imporive our applicaitons performance.

full stack development of a frontend and a backened for an applicaion.
true full stack developwmnt includes a databse, a logic/ server and a frontend built in javascript, HTML and CSS.

backend - the layer if a full stack application that handles business logic and other programmatic tasks that useds 
so notn or should not see.
can be written in python java and ruby PHP etc.
front end is a layer of fulls stack that users see and intract with.

Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)- a methid for a server to indicate any paorts for server that can share its resources.

transmission control protocol - a protocol that defines how computers send data ti each other.
A connection is formed and stays active until the appllication on either end have finished sending data to one another.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol a stateless protocol where applkcaitons communicate fo he lenght of time it takes for data to be transfered.

Websocket - A protocl that allows clients and servers to communicate with one another in both directio.
The bidirectional nature of webseocket communication allows a connections state to be generates and the connection maintaineed until it is termincated by one side.
This allows for speedy and seamless connections between frontend and backends.
